 ## About This Project
 
 {{ Give a brief description of your project here. What is it for, how do you useit? }}
 
 ## How To Run This Code
 
 {{Give a quick step-by-step guide on how to download and run your codebase.It's ok to assume the reader is another developer here, so don't feel like youhave to explain what a virtual environment is, etc.
 Give directions like "clone the repo to your local machine", "create a virtualenvironment", "migrate the database", etc.

When you need to specify terminal commands, you can surround them withbackticks, like so: `python manage.py runserver`. This formats them ascode in the markdown document. (The backtick key is to the left of thenumber 1 at the top of your keyboard.)}}
